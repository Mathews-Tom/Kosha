# zipfile.ZipFile

Class with methods to open, read, write, close, list zip files.

z = ZipFile(file, mode="r", compression=ZIP_STORED, allowZip64=True,
            compresslevel=None)

file: Either the path to the file, or a file-like object.
      If it is a path, the file will be opened and closed by ZipFile.
mode: The mode can be either read 'r', write 'w', exclusive create 'x',
      or append 'a'.
compression: ZIP_STORED (no compression), ZIP_DEFLATED (requires zlib),
             ZIP_BZIP2 (requires bz2) or ZIP_LZMA (requires lzma).
allowZip64: if True ZipFile will create files with ZIP64 extensions when
            needed, otherwise it will raise an exception when this would
            be necessary.
compresslevel: None (default for the given compression type) or an integer
               specifying the level to pass to the compressor.
               When using ZIP_STORED or ZIP_LZMA this keyword has no effect.
               When using ZIP_DEFLATED integers 0 through 9 are accepted.
               When using ZIP_BZIP2 integers 1 through 9 are accepted.

# bisect.bisect

Return the index where to insert item x in list a, assuming a is sorted.

The return value i is such that all e in a[:i] have e <= x, and all e in
a[i:] have e > x.  So if x already appears in the list, a.insert(i, x) will
insert just after the rightmost x already there.

Optional args lo (default 0) and hi (default len(a)) bound the
slice of a to be searched.

A custom key function can be supplied to customize the sort order.

# tempfile.TemporaryDirectory

Create and return a temporary directory.  This has the same
behavior as mkdtemp but can be used as a context manager.  For
example:

    with TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
        ...

Upon exiting the context, the directory and everything contained
in it are removed (unless delete=False is passed or an exception
is raised during cleanup and ignore_cleanup_errors is not True).

Optional Arguments:
    suffix - A str suffix for the directory name.  (see mkdtemp)
    prefix - A str prefix for the directory name.  (see mkdtemp)
    dir - A directory to create this temp dir in.  (see mkdtemp)
    ignore_cleanup_errors - False; ignore exceptions during cleanup?
    delete - True; whether the directory is automatically deleted.

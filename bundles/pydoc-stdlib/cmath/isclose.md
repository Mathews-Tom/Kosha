# cmath.isclose

Determine whether two complex numbers are close in value.

  rel_tol
    maximum difference for being considered "close", relative to the
    magnitude of the input values
  abs_tol
    maximum difference for being considered "close", regardless of the
    magnitude of the input values

Return True if a is close in value to b, and False otherwise.

For the values to be considered close, the difference between them must be
smaller than at least one of the tolerances.

-inf, inf and NaN behave similarly to the IEEE 754 Standard. That is, NaN is
not close to anything, even itself. inf and -inf are only close to themselves.

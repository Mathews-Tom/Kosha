# base64.a85decode

Decode the Ascii85 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string b.

foldspaces is a flag that specifies whether the 'y' short sequence should be
accepted as shorthand for 4 consecutive spaces (ASCII 0x20). This feature is
not supported by the "standard" Adobe encoding.

adobe controls whether the input sequence is in Adobe Ascii85 format (i.e.
is framed with <~ and ~>).

ignorechars should be a byte string containing characters to ignore from the
input. This should only contain whitespace characters, and by default
contains all whitespace characters in ASCII.

The result is returned as a bytes object.

# functools.lru_cache

Least-recently-used cache decorator.

If *maxsize* is set to None, the LRU features are disabled and the cache
can grow without bound.

If *typed* is True, arguments of different types will be cached separately.
For example, f(3.0) and f(3) will be treated as distinct calls with
distinct results.

Arguments to the cached function must be hashable.

View the cache statistics named tuple (hits, misses, maxsize, currsize)
with f.cache_info().  Clear the cache and statistics with f.cache_clear().
Access the underlying function with f.__wrapped__.
